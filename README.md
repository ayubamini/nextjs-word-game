## üéÆ Live Demo

[Play Word Puzzle Game](https://your-demo-link-here.vercel.app)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Daily Challenge**: A new word to guess every day
- **Limited Attempts**: Just like Wordle, players have six tries to guess the daily word
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded tiles indicate correct letters and positions
- **Score Tracking**: Player statistics and leaderboard functionality
- **Countdown Timer**: Shows time until the next daily puzzle
- **Theme Switching**: Toggle between light and dark modes with smooth transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile
- **Animations**: Polished interactions and visual feedback throughout the game
- **Modern UI**: Sleek design with gradient effects and glass morphism

## üöÄ Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions
- **Local Storage**: For persisting game state and player preferences

## üìã How to Play

1. Try to guess the secret 5-letter word in six attempts or fewer
2. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change:
   - **Green**: The letter is correct and in the right position
   - **Yellow**: The letter is correct but in the wrong position
   - **Gray**: The letter is not in the word
3. Continue guessing until you either solve the puzzle or run out of attempts
4. A new word is available each day
